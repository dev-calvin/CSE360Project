# CSE360Project

THE FOLLOWING IS COPY PASTED FROM THE USER GUIDE FOR THE PROJECT. SOME IMAGES WILL BE MISSING.

Introduction
The following document covers how to create a to-do list as well as the various functions that a user can use to manipulate the entries of the to-do list. The program overview section of the document shows how the program works and all the different functions that a user can do to manipulate a to-do list, as well as the specific constraints of each entry. The document includes an installation technique on how the user will be able to install the program by downloading a zip file that contains a jar file and a storage folder. After a user has completed installation, there is a getting started portion of the document that highlights what the user will see when they first open the user interface, including a minor description of each button’s location and function. The user interface overview shows what the user interface looks like and how the user is able to access certain functions of the program. The example runs portion of the document shows examples of how the interface will look when it is used to completion as well as explaining any error messages that a user might get from not inputting all of the necessary information. The restarting portion of the document explains how a user can restart the program. The document also explains how to exit the program and the necessary tasks that a user must do in order to successfully exit the program. 

Program Overview
The program will allow a user to create a to-do list that can be manipulated in numerous ways. The user is able to add an entry to the to-do list, delete an entry, change an entry, complete an entry, display the entire list, print a report of the contents of the list, save the list, and restore the list. Each entry will consist of a description, priority number, due date, and the completion status of the project. If the status of an entry is listed as ‘in progress’, the start date of the entry will be shown. If the status of an entry is listed as ‘finished’, the date that the entry was completed will be shown. A user can change the contents of an entry including but not limited to: changing the description, updating the priority, updating the due date of the entry, and updating the status of an entry. An entry that has been marked as completed by the user will be removed from the list. A user can display the to-do list based on the description of each entry, the priority of each entry, the due date of each entry, or the completion status of each entry. The user can choose to print a report of the to do list which will show the entire contents of the to-do list, including the entries that have been completed or deleted. In the report, any completed tasks will have a status that says complete along with the date that the task was completed. The user is able to save the to-do list in order to access the to-do list at any time, even if the user exits the user interface. A user can restore the to-do list which will give the user access to the saved to-do list and allow the user to manipulate the to-do list. 

Installation
The user will have to download and unpack a zip file. This zip file will contain a folder with a JAR file inside. Do not remove the JAR file from the folder. To use the list simply go into the folder and run the JAR file. List saves and reports will be saved to the folder. As long as you do not rename the folder, the list program will be able to write saves and reports to the folder in the form of text files.

Getting Started 
When the user opens up the JAR file, the user will have access to the user interface. The user can then upload any existing to-do list by clicking on the restore button. If there are no existing to-do lists or if the user wants to create a new to-do list, the user can create or add an entry. The user can also choose to sort entries based on status, priority number, description, and due date by selecting the sort button. If the user chooses to restore a to-do list, a user can edit any existing entries by clicking on the entry. This will take the user into a window where the user can edit the description, the status, the priority number, and the due date. The user can choose to print a report in order to see all entries of the to-do list, including those that have been completed or deleted. The user also has the option to save the to-do list by selecting the save button. 

User Interface Overview
The picture above shows an example of a to-do list on a user interface. The user interface will show an entry’s priority number, an entry’s due date, the title of an entry, and the status of an entry. If the entry has been started and is currently in progress, the entry’s start date will be shown.  

The picture above shows how a user can choose to create or add an entry by clicking the ‘add note’ button in the top left corner of the home screen which will take the user to a window where they can add a description/title, the due date, and the priority number of an entry. Since it is a new entry, the status is automatically assigned as ‘not started’. After the user has input the information for creating a new entry, the user must select the ‘create’ button in the bottom right of the window in order for the entry to be added to the to-do list. This is important in making sure that there are no errors and that all fields of the entry have been added.  

The picture above shows how a user will be able to edit an entry. The user can edit an entry’s contents by clicking on an entry. The user has the option to delete the entry or mark the entry as completed. The user does not have to click the ‘save’ button if they have chosen to delete an entry or if they have marked it as complete. A user can choose to edit the title, due date, priority number, or status and they must click on the save button if they have edited at least one portion of an entry. It is not mandatory for the user to fill in every text box when editing an entry. If the user changes their mind about editing, they can simply click the save button without inputting any information. 

The picture above shows the window a user will see when they click the sort button. The user is able to sort entries based on the title, due date, priority number, and status. The user will fill in a radio button and click the ‘set priority’ button. This will take them back to the home page and display the to-do list sorted by what the user selected. 





The picture above shows the report that is created when the user clicks on the ‘Report’ button. A text file will open that will display the to-do list along with completed entries and deleted entries. The completed entries do not have a priority number and their status is listed as completed, along with the date that the entry was completed. The deleted entries only consist of due dates and the description. 

The photo above shows the message that a user will see if they exit the program without saving the to-do list. This message will pop up when a user tries to exit the program or restart the program without saving. 






Example Runs

The picture above shows an example of what the list will look like when the list has been sorted based on the priority number. The list will display all entries based on the priority number of each entry.    

The picture above shows an error message that results because the user did not input all of the information in order to create or add an entry. The user did not input a due date for the entry and was unable to create/add the entry. The error message lets the user know that the due date is required and must be inputted in order to create/add the entry. 

Restarting 
A user can restart the program by exiting the program and re-opening the program. A user can restart the program by clicking the exit button in the top right corner which will end the program and simply clicking on the jar file. The user will then be taken to an empty to-do list where they can choose to restore the original list or create a new list by adding entries. In order to restore the original list, the user must save the list before restarting the program. If the user decides to restart the program before exiting the list, there will be a pop-up window that will ask the user if they would like to save the to-do list before they exit the program. If the user chooses to restart the program without saving the to-do list, all contents of the to-do list will be deleted and will not be stored in the folder. The deleted list will also not be shown in any report.
 
Ending the Program 
The user can end a program by simply clicking on the exit button in the top right corner which will close the program. The user must save the to-do list before exiting the program. If the user decides to exit the program before exiting the list, there will be a pop-up window that will ask the user if they would like to save the to-do list before they exit the program. If the user chooses to exit the program without saving the to-do list, all contents of the to-do list will be deleted and will not be stored in the folder. The unsaved list will not be shown in any report.
